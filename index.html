        <p>“Benjamin Franklin may have discovered electricity, but it was the man who invented the meter who made the money.”  You may or may not have the college of your choice, however, how you build your character matters much more than a mere building.</p>

	<p>"A wise man once said, 'There's no certainty in life, but there's always hope.'"</p>

	<p>"A set back is a setup for a comeback."</p>
	<p>"A wise man once said, 'There's no certainty in life, but there's always hope.'"</p>
	<p>"Sometimes, life is like this dark tunnel. You can't always see the light at the end of the tunnel, but if you just keep moving... you will come to a better place."</p>
	<p>"Hard times pass, but tough people last forever."</p>
	<p>"One must never lose heart, even when in an adverse situation. Hope is never lost as long as the spirit remains unbroken."</p>
	<p>"Sometimes the only choice is to forge ahead and see where we end up."</p>
	<p>"Worry is a misuse of imagination."</p>
	<p>"I can't always choose the way the wind blows, but I can adjust my sails. And keep going, even when the winds are against you."</p>
	<p>"Don't worry about the clouds in the sky, or the storm in the sea. Worry about the calm on the shore and the sunshine after the rain."</p>
	<p>"In an uncertain world, the only certainty is that there is no perfect path to follow."</p>
	<p>and my personal favourite.....</p>
	<p>“Rocks in my path? I keep them all. With them I shall build my castle.”</p>
